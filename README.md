The advent of the World Wide Web and the rapid adoption of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter have revolutionized the dissemination of information, creating an unprecedented scale of content sharing. As a result, consumers are generating and distributing more information than ever before, some of which is misleading or entirely disconnected from reality. The automated classification of text articles as misinformation or disinformation presents a significant challenge. Even domain experts must consider multiple facets before determining the veracity of an article. In this work, we propose using a machine learning ensemble approach for the automated classification of news articles. Our study investigates various textual properties that can help differentiate between fake and genuine content. Leveraging these properties, we train a combination of different machine learning algorithms using various ensemble methods. Instead of using pre-existing datasets, we employ web scraping methods to extract news articles directly from the web, ensuring a diverse and up-to-date collection of content for our analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed ensemble learning approach compared to individual learners.
